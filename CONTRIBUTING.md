# How To Contribute

If you find the Okra Framework useful and wish to contribute we would love to hear from you. It could be as small as submitting a feature request or bug report. Alternatively you could fix a bug or implement a new feature and send us a pull request. To keep everyone happy here are a few guidelines to follow.

## Submitting feature requests

* Submit any feature requests on [the Okra.Core issue tracker](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues).
* Check if anyone has already submitted a request for the same feature - if they have then feel free to add a comment to their request, even if it is just a "+1".

## Submitting bug reports

* Submit any bug reports on [the Okra.Core issue tracker](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues).
* Try to include as much information as you can to describe the bug.
* Include code snippets if possible.

## Contributing code

If you would like to contribute code to the project then we would love to accept pull requests. A few simple guidelines to follow are,

* For anything but the most simple changes, please add a feature request or bug report to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues) stating that you would be interested in contributing. This lets the Okra Framework team and the community know you are looking into it, and starts a discussion about the best way to tackle the problem.
* Follow a similar coding style to the existing codebase.
* Try to keep pull requests as small as possible - it makes it a lot easier for us to review the changes before merging into the main codebase.
* Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed, except in very special circumstances.
